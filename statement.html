      What is
      <a class="in_text_link" href="./index.html">unseen</a>?
      <br>Unseen is hidden, unseen is invisibility, unseen is like something haven't discovered. Unseen doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
      Differently, it means it does exist. But you have never seen it before in the real life. Once you see it, you can't un-see it anymore.
      <br>Lots of us are born in modern cities who have never seen a rural area before. Modern cities let us completely forget about the great about the nature.
      <br>In this website, I will display the things we can't discover in the modern cities.
      In a modern city, we can see the high-rise buildings, paved road and street lights.
      However, we cannot see the
      <a href="./forests.html" class="in_text_link"><strong>forests</strong></a>,
      <a href="./trails.html" class="in_text_link"><strong>natural trails</strong></a>
      and the <a class="in_text_link" href="./stars.html"><strong>endless galaxy</strong></a> in the cities as we can in the rural areas.
      <br>Here, I want to share the scenes which is
      <a class="in_text_link" href="./index.html">UNSEEN</a>
      in the modern cities.
      These photos are taken by myself when I was travelling to some rural towns in New Brunswick, Canada during previous years.
      During the trip, I have seen so many of views that I have never seen in my life.
      These views with forests, trails and stars will be shared into each web page in this project.
      <br>At the end, I would like to have more and more people can enjoy and fall in love to the natural views.
